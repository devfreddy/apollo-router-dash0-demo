# 🚀 START HERE

Welcome! This is your quick-start guide for the dashboard conversion project.

---

## What is This?

A complete system for converting Datadog dashboards to Dash0 (Perses format), with:
- ✅ Working converter (Phase A - just refactored)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Clear roadmap for future improvements
- ✅ Professional codebase

---

## What's New?

**Phase A (Simple Refactor) is COMPLETE** ✅

The `convert.js` has been refactored to be clearer and more maintainable:
- 3 config files extract rules (no longer hardcoded)
- 70+ comment lines explain the logic
- 100% backward compatible (behavior unchanged)
- Ready to use immediately

---

## Quick Decision: What Do You Want to Do?

### Option A: Just Use It 🎯
```
→ You want working code right now
→ Code quality doesn't matter much
→ You're happy with current convert.js

DO THIS:
  1. Read this file (you're doing it!)
  2. Use the refactored convert.js
  3. Run: node convert.js
  4. Check generated dashboards
  5. Done! ✅
```

### Option B: Understand the System 📚
```
→ You want to understand how it works
→ You might extend or modify it
→ You want to plan future work

DO THIS:
  1. Read PHASES.md (5 min)
  2. Read PHASE_A_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
  3. Read docs/QUICK_START.md for conversion patterns
  4. Review config/ files
  5. Read comments in convert.js
```

### Option C: Plan Next Steps 🔮
```
→ You want professional library code
→ You want to build tools on top
→ You want multi-format support

DO THIS:
  1. Read PHASES.md (full) - 15 min
  2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md - 20 min
  3. Discuss Phase B with your team
  4. Plan timeline
  5. Start Phase B

## Next 5 Minutes: What to Do

### Step 1: Verify It Works (1 min)
```bash
cd dashboards
node convert.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Dashboard converted successfully!
📊 Panels created: 41
✨ All done!
```

### Step 2: Review What Changed (2 min)
Look at these new files:

## Next Steps (Pick One)

### 🎯 I just want it to work
- ✅ Done! Phase A is complete
- Use the refactored `convert.js`
- Run `node convert.js` whenever you need

### 📚 I want to understand it
1. Read `PHASES.md`
2. Read `PHASE_A_SUMMARY.md`
3. Read comments in `convert.js`
4. Check `config/` files

### 🔮 I want to improve it (Phase B)
1. Read `PHASES.md` (full)
2. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
3. Review `CONVERSION_STRATEGY.md`
4. Discuss with team
5. Plan timeline
6. Start Phase B

### 🌐 I want multi-format support (Phase C)
1. Complete Phase B first
2. Then add Grafana support
3. Then add New Relic support
4. Then other formats

## FAQ

**Q: Is the code ready to use?**
A: Yes! Phase A is complete. Code works identically to original but is much clearer.

**Q: What changed in Phase A?**
A: Rules extracted to JSON config files and comprehensive comments added. No behavior changes.

**Q: Should I do Phase B?**
A: Only if you want professional library code or plan multi-format support. Phase A is good enough to use now.

**Q: How long is Phase A→B→C?**
A: Phase A (done), Phase B (1-2 weeks), Phase C (4-8 weeks).

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: Not really. Each builds on the previous.

**Q: Where are the phases documented?**
A: PHASES.md, PHASE_A_SUMMARY.md, and IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md.

## How to Use

### Generate Dashboards
```bash
node convert.js
```

### Review Generated Files
```bash
ls dash0/
# See 7 dashboard files
```

### Deploy to Dash0 (if configured)
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Add New Metric Types
Edit `config/metric-types.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "my_new_metric",
  "pattern": "my_metric",
  "type": "histogram",
  "confidence": "high"
}
```

### Update Label Mappings
Edit `config/attribute-mappings.json`:
```json
{
  "my.label": {
    "dash0_name": "my_label",
    "description": "My label description"
  }
}
```

---

## What's Different from Original?

### Better Organization
- Rules are data-driven (JSON config)
- Not hardcoded in JavaScript

### Better Documentation
- 70+ comment lines added
- Explains the "why" not just "what"
- References external docs

### Same Functionality
- Zero behavior changes
- 100% backward compatible
- All tests pass

### Easier to Maintain
- Adding metrics = edit JSON (not code)
- Clearer logic flow
- Self-documenting code

---

## Real Quick Example

### Want to add a new metric type?

Before (hardcoded):
```javascript
if (metricName.includes('mymetric')) {
  return 'histogram';
}
```

After (data-driven):
Edit `config/metric-types.json`:
```json
{
  "id": "my_custom_metric",
  "pattern": "mymetric",
  "type": "histogram",
  "description": "My custom metric is a histogram"
}
```

No code changes needed! ✅
