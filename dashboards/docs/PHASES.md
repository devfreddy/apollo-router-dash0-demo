# Implementation Phases Reference

## Overview

The dashboard conversion project is organized into three phases, each building on the previous:

- **Phase A**: Simple Refactor (1-2 days) - ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Phase B**: JavaScript Library (1-2 weeks) - Not started
- **Phase C**: Multi-Format Support (Future) - Planning phase

---

## Phase A: Simple Refactor ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: ✅ Done
**Duration**: ~1-2 days
**Effort**: Low
**Risk**: Minimal (no behavior changes)

### What was done:
- Extracted metric type rules to JSON config
- Extracted aggregation patterns to JSON config
- Extracted attribute mappings to JSON config
- Added comprehensive comments throughout code
- Verified behavior unchanged

### Files created:
- `config/metric-types.json` - 19 rules
- `config/aggregation-patterns.json` - PromQL patterns
- `config/attribute-mappings.json` - Label mappings

### Files refactored:
- `convert.js` - Added 70+ comment lines, made clearer

### Benefits delivered:
- ✅ Code is now self-documenting
- ✅ Rules are data-driven, easier to modify
- ✅ Foundation for Phase B
- ✅ Zero behavior changes - safe to deploy

### How to use Phase A results:
1. Use the refactored `convert.js` - it works identically
2. Read comments to understand conversion logic
3. Refer to config files when adding new metrics
4. Check `PHASE_A_SUMMARY.md` for detailed changes

## Phase B: JavaScript Library (Next)

**Status**: 📋 Planning
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Effort**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (can test in isolation)

### What will be done:
- Create modular library structure
- Split conversion functions into separate modules
- Extract rules to library constants
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Build CLI/API on top of library

### Expected files:
```
src/
├── index.js                    # Library export
├── converters/
│   ├── dashboard.js
│   ├── widget.js
│   └── query.js
├── transforms/
│   ├── metric-type.js
│   ├── aggregation.js
│   ├── attribute-mapping.js
│   └── promql-builder.js
├── rules/                      # Load from JSON
└── utils/

test/
├── unit/                       # Test individual functions
└── integration/                # Test full conversion
```

### Decision: Library or Incremental?
Choose based on your goals:

**Choose Library if:**
- Want professional, reusable code
- Plan to build tools/CLI on top
- Want to support multiple formats later
- Have time/resources for 1-2 weeks

**Choose Incremental if:**
- Want quick 80/20 improvement
- Have limited time
- Can iterate later
- Prefer proven path

### How to start Phase B:
1. Review Phase A changes
2. Run `node convert.js` - verify it works
3. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` for library design
4. Decide: library vs incremental
5. Plan timeline with team

---

## Phase C: Multi-Format Support (Future)

**Status**: 🔮 Future
**Duration**: 4-8 weeks (total)
**Effort**: High
**Prerequisites**: Phase B library complete

### What will be done:

#### C1: Grafana Support (1-2 weeks)
- Add Grafana dashboard parser
- Create Grafana → PromQL converter (minimal - already PromQL)
- Add Grafana panel type mappings
- Create GRAFANA_REFERENCE.md documentation

**Why Grafana first:**
- Easier than New Relic (already uses PromQL)
- High value (many companies use Grafana)
- Good learning for multi-format architecture

#### C2: New Relic Support (3-4 weeks)
- Create NRQL → PromQL translator (hardest part)
- Add New Relic metric type detection
- Create New Relic panel mappings
- Create NEWRELIC_QUERY_REFERENCE.md documentation

**Why New Relic:**
- More complex (different query language)
- Valuable for teams using New Relic
- Demonstrates extensibility

#### C3: Other Formats (Optional)
- CloudWatch support
- DataDog → Grafana (reverse)
- etc.

### Architecture for Multi-Format:

```
sources/
├── datadog/
│   ├── parser.js          # Parse Datadog JSON
│   ├── query-translator.js # Datadog → PromQL
│   └── panel-mapper.js     # Datadog panel types
├── grafana/
│   ├── parser.js
│   ├── query-translator.js # Pass-through (already PromQL)
│   └── panel-mapper.js
└── newrelic/
    ├── parser.js
    ├── query-translator.js # NRQL → PromQL
    └── panel-mapper.js

targets/
└── perses/                 # Shared output generator

docs/
├── DATADOG_QUERY_REFERENCE.md      (existing)
├── GRAFANA_DASHBOARD_REFERENCE.md  (new)
└── NEWRELIC_QUERY_REFERENCE.md     (new)
```

### How Phase C benefits from Phase A & B:
- Phase A extracted rules → easy to replicate for new formats
- Phase B created architecture → plugin pattern ready
- Phase A docs → template for new format docs
- Both provide solid foundation

### Timeline Example:
```
Week 1-2:   Phase B Library
Week 3-4:   C1 Grafana Support
Week 5-8:   C2 New Relic Support
Week 9+:    C3 Additional formats
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Phase A now?**
A: Yes! It's complete and ready. Behavior is 100% identical to original.

**Q: Do I have to do Phase B?**
A: No. Phase A is a complete improvement. Phase B is optional for more advanced needs.

**Q: Should I do Phase B before Phase C?**
A: Yes. Phase B creates the library architecture needed for Phase C multi-format support.

**Q: How long does each phase take?**
A: Phase A (done), Phase B (1-2 weeks), Phase C (4-8 weeks total).

**Q: Can I skip phases?**
A: Not really. Each phase builds on previous. Phase A → Phase B → Phase C.

**Q: What if I only care about Datadog?**
A: Phase A is sufficient! Phases B & C are for extensibility and other formats.

## Next Step

Read `PHASE_A_SUMMARY.md` for detailed changes, then decide:

- ✅ **Use Phase A now** - refactored code is ready
- 📋 **Plan Phase B** - review `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- 🔮 **Consider Phase C** - for future multi-format support

**Default recommendation**: Use Phase A results now, evaluate Phase B after gathering feedback.
