# Session Wrap-Up: 2025-10-11

## Session Summary

Successfully completed verification and testing of Dash0 MCP server integration with the Apollo Router demo environment.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Verified Dash0 MCP Integration
- ✅ Confirmed all MCP tools are operational
- ✅ Successfully connected to Dash0 API via MCP server
- ✅ Discovered 2 available datasets (Default, OTel Demo)

### 2. Service Discovery & Analysis
- ✅ Identified 4 services: apollo-router-demo, products, reviews, accounts
- ✅ Retrieved RED metrics (Requests, Errors, Duration) for apollo-router-demo
- ✅ Analyzed primary operation: `POST /` with 698 requests/hour

### 3. Metrics Catalog Exploration
- ✅ Discovered 59 metrics available for Apollo Router
- ✅ Identified key metric categories:
  - Apollo Router specific (operations, cache, query planning, memory)
  - HTTP metrics (request duration, body size, active requests)
  - Dash0 platform metrics (spans, logs, datapoints)

### 4. Error Investigation
- ✅ Performed trace error triage analysis
- ✅ Identified 30% error rate from Bad Request (400) errors
- ✅ Determined root cause: Intentional load testing with invalid GraphQL queries
- ✅ Found errors originate before subgraph routing

### 5. PromQL Query Testing
- ✅ Built PromQL queries for P95 latency and request rates
- ✅ Executed queries and retrieved time-series data
- ✅ Confirmed performance metrics:
  - Successful requests: 1.42 req/sec, ~14-15ms P95 latency
  - Bad requests: 0.58 req/sec, ~0.95ms P95 latency
  - Total: 2 req/sec (matches Vegeta configuration)

### 6. Documentation
- ✅ Updated SESSION_NOTES.md with comprehensive test results
- ✅ Documented PromQL query examples
- ✅ Captured all findings and insights

## Key Insights

1. **Dash0 MCP Integration Works Flawlessly** - All 20+ MCP tools function correctly for querying metrics, traces, logs, and building PromQL queries

2. **Rich Metric Availability** - Apollo Router exports comprehensive telemetry including query planning, caching, memory usage, and HTTP performance

3. **Error Pattern Identified** - The 30% error rate is intentional from load testing and can be reduced by improving Vegeta query payloads

4. **Performance Baseline Established** - Router performs well with 14-15ms P95 latency at 2 req/sec load

## Next Steps

For the next session, we have five clear paths forward:

1. **Create Dash0 Dashboard** - Build observability dashboard using discovered metrics
2. **Investigate Bad Request Errors** - Review Vegeta load test queries to reduce error rate
3. **Add Query Variations** - Expand load testing with more realistic GraphQL query patterns
4. **Monitor Subgraph Performance** - Add detailed metrics for individual subgraph performance
5. **Set Up Alerts** - Configure Dash0 alerts for error rate and latency thresholds

## Files Modified

- [SESSION_NOTES.md](SESSION_NOTES.md) - Added MCP Testing Results section with comprehensive findings
