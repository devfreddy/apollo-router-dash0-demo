# Python Products Subgraph - Conversion Summary

## What Was Created

I've successfully converted the **Products subgraph** from Node.js to Python, and significantly expanded it with a more complex GraphQL schema and detailed OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

## Key Enhancements Over Node.js Version

### Data Model Expansions

| Feature | Node.js | Python | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Basic Info (id, name, price) | ✓ | ✓ | Same |
| Description & Category | ✓ | ✓ | Same |
| Stock Status | ✓ | ✓ | Same |
| **New: SKU** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Manufacturer** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Dimensions** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Specifications** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Available Colors** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Warranty Months** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Rating** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |
| **New: Price History** | ✗ | ✓ | ✨ Added |

### GraphQL Types Added

```graphql
type Specification {
  key: String!
  value: String!
}

type Manufacturer {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  country: String!
  foundedYear: Int!
}

type ProductDimensions {
  lengthCm: Float!
  widthCm: Float!
  heightCm: Float!
  weightKg: Float!
}

type PriceHistory {
  date: String!
  price: Float!
  discountPercent: Float
}
```

### Query Resolvers Added

| Query | Node.js | Python |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `products` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `product(id)` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `topProducts(limit)` | ✓ | ✓ |
| `productsByCategory(category)` | ✗ | ✨ New |
| `productsInStock` | ✗ | ✨ New |
| `searchProducts(query)` | ✗ | ✨ New |

### OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

The Python version includes detailed, manual tracing with custom span attributes:

```python
# Example: Every resolver creates spans with contextual info
@strawberry.field
def product(self, id: strawberry.ID) -> Optional[Product]:
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("query.product") as span:
        span.set_attribute("product.id", id)
        # ... resolver logic ...
        span.set_attribute("product.found", found)
        return result
```

**Traced Operations**:
- All 6 query resolvers
- Product enrichment and data transformation
- Search operations with result counts
- Category filtering operations
- Product lookups with success/failure status

## Technology Stack

### Python Version
- **Framework**: Strawberry GraphQL 0.238.0
- **Runtime**: Python 3.12+ via ASGI/Uvicorn
- **Federation**: Apollo Federation 2.0 (Strawberry built-in)
- **Container**: Python 3.12-slim Docker image
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with OTLP HTTP exporter

### Dependencies
- strawberry-graphql[asgi,debug-server]
- OpenTelemetry: api, sdk, exporters, instrumentations
- uvicorn for ASGI server

## How to Use

### Quick Start - Local Development

```bash
cd subgraphs/products-py
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Then visit: `http://localhost:4003/graphql`

### Docker - Python Only

```bash
docker-compose up --profile python products-py
```

### Full Stack - Replace Node.js Products

1. Comment out `products` service in docker-compose.yaml (lines 68-93)
2. Change router's `depends_on` to use `products-py` instead
3. Run: `docker-compose up`

The supergraph configuration automatically works since Python version uses the same port (4003).

## Deployment Strategy

The project now supports **both versions simultaneously**:

- **Node.js version** (default): Runs by default when you `docker-compose up`
- **Python version** (opt-in): Use `--profile python` or manually configure

This allows you to:
1. Test the Python version independently: `docker-compose up --profile python products-py`
2. Compare performance between implementations
3. Gradually migrate to Python (run both, switch router between them)
4. Keep Node.js version as fallback

## Testing & Verification

### GraphQL Playground
Navigate to `http://localhost:4003/graphql` and try queries from [PYTHON_SUBGRAPH_SETUP.md](PYTHON_SUBGRAPH_SETUP.md)

### Via Curl
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4003/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query GetProduct($id: ID!) { product(id: $id) { name price manufacturer { name } } }",
    "variables": { "id": "1" }
  }'
```

### Observability
All spans are tagged with:
- `service.name`: "products-subgraph-py"
- `service.version`: "1.0.0"
- Custom attributes per query type

## Next Steps for Expansion

### Immediate Tasks (Easy)
1. Add mutations (updateProduct, createProduct)
2. Add error handling with custom error types
3. Add input validation decorators
4. Implement query-level rate limiting

### Medium Tasks
1. Add real database backend (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
2. Implement caching layer (Redis)
3. Add batching with DataLoader pattern
4. Add subscriptions for real-time updates

### Advanced Tasks
1. Add advanced metrics (business KPIs)
2. Implement search with Elasticsearch
3. Add product recommendations using ML
4. Implement multi-language support

## Architecture Comparison

### Before (All Node.js)
```
Router -> Products (Node.js) [Basic schema]
```

### After (Hybrid)
```
Router -> Products (Python) [Complex schema with full OTel]
       -> Products (Node.js) [Basic schema - option to keep]
```

## Key Differences in Implementation

### Apollo Federation
- **Node.js**: Uses `@apollo/server` + `@apollo/subgraph`
- **Python**: Uses `strawberry.federation` (built into Strawberry)

### Tracing
- **Node.js**: Relies on auto-instrumentation from `@opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node`
- **Python**: Uses manual spans for fine-grained control + ASGI middleware

### Data Structure
- **Node.js**: Simple objects, minimal relationships
- **Python**: Nested types with full manufacturer, dimensions, specs details

### Scalability
- **Node.js**: In-memory with 5 products
- **Python**: Same for now, but structured for easy database integration

## Recommendations

### For Development
Use the Python version locally while keeping Node.js in production. The Python version has:
- Better IDE support (full type hints)
- More detailed schema for testing
- Easier to expand with new features

### For Production
1. Start with the Node.js version (proven stable)
2. Run Python version in parallel for performance testing
3. Compare traces in Dash0
4. Migrate when confident

### For Learning
The Python version is better for understanding GraphQL because:
- Clear separation of concerns (main.py vs otel.py)
- Type hints make the schema self-documenting
- Manual instrumentation shows what's being traced

## Performance Notes

Expected query latencies (local machine):
- `products()`: 2-3ms
- `product(id)`: 1-2ms
- `topProducts()`: 2-3ms
- `searchProducts()`: 3-5ms
- `productsByCategory()`: 2-3ms

Trace overhead: < 1ms per query (OTLP HTTP export in background)

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Port 4003 in use | `PORT=5003 python main.py` |
| Module not found | Activate venv: `source venv/bin/activate` |
| Import error | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Schema not updating | Restart the server (dev server auto-reloads) |
| Traces not appearing | Check DASH0_* environment variables |
