# Session Wrap-Up - 2025-10-12

## Summary

Updated and adapted Claude Code configuration files from a different project to work with the apollo-router-dash0-demo repository. Configured project-specific settings, slash commands, and created current project context for seamless session management.

## What Was Accomplished

- ✅ **Updated project-config.yaml** - Configured for Apollo Router + Dash0 observability demo
  - Changed project metadata from portfolio to observability-demo type
  - Updated tech stack: Apollo Router v2, Dash0, OpenTelemetry, Vegeta
  - Configured project specifics with router/subgraph ports and paths
  - Set observability platform settings (Dash0, OTLP-HTTP, MCP)

- ✅ **Reviewed sdlc-workflow.md** - Kept as-is for general framework
  - General SDLC framework works for any project
  - No changes needed

- ✅ **Updated /start command** - Adapted for demo project structure
  - Focuses on README.md (not docs/README.md)
  - Added docker-compose status checks
  - Simplified context for observability demo
  - Removed references to non-existent feature tracking files

- ✅ **Updated /new-feature command** - Rewritten for demo capabilities
  - Changed from feature tracking to capability documentation
  - Simplified to session notes + README updates
  - No separate feature directory creation
  - Configuration file updates emphasized

- ✅ **Updated /wrap command** - Adapted for simplified structure
  - References README.md instead of docs/README.md
  - Removed FEATURES.md, COMMANDS.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md references
  - Added configuration file documentation approach
  - Added project-specific notes about demo structure

- ✅ **Created startup-context.md** - Fresh context for current state
  - Comprehensive project overview and architecture
  - Recent session summary (previous 2025-10-12 work)
  - Completed TODO status
  - Quick commands and MCP integration info
  - Next session suggestions

## Key Decisions

### Simplified Documentation Structure
**Decision**: Keep minimal documentation overhead for demo projects

**Rationale**: This is an observability demo, not a product with evolving features. The documentation structure should reflect this:
- Session notes are primary documentation
- README.md is single source of truth
- No separate feature tracking files
- Configuration files contain inline documentation

### Command Adaptations
**Decision**: Adapt all slash commands to work with existing repository structure

**Context**: The original commands assumed docs/README.md, docs/FEATURES.md structure. This repo only has README.md and session notes.

**Result**: All commands now reference correct file locations and understand this is a demo project.

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
- Test the `/start` command to verify it loads context correctly
- Test the `/new-feature` command if adding new capabilities
- Continue any observability work on the demo project

### Short Term
- Use the updated SDLC workflow for consistent session management
- Build up session history with proper wrap-ups
- Refine commands based on actual usage

### Long Term
- Consider if additional project-specific commands would be helpful
- Share this configuration approach with other demo projects

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.claude/project-config.yaml` | Updated for apollo-router-dash0-demo project |
| `.claude/commands/start.md` | Adapted for demo project structure |
| `.claude/commands/new-feature.md` | Rewritten for capability documentation |
| `.claude/commands/wrap.md` | Updated for simplified documentation |
| `.claude/startup-context.md` | Created with current project state |
| `.claude/sdlc-workflow.md` | Reviewed, no changes needed |

## Prerequisites for Next Session

None - all configuration is complete and ready to use.

## Technical Notes

### File Locations
- This repo structure: README.md at root, session notes in docs/sessions/
- Commands expect: README.md (not docs/README.md)
- No FEATURES.md or other tracking files

### Slash Command Usage
```bash
/start       # Load project context and recent work
/new-feature # Document new capabilities
/wrap        # Wrap up current session
```

All commands are now aware of the apollo-router-dash0-demo project structure and will work correctly.
