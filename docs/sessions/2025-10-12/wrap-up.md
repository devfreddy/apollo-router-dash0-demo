# Session Wrap-Up - 2025-10-12

## Summary

Fixed Docker health checks and Apollo Router telemetry configuration to establish complete observability of the federated GraphQL architecture in Dash0. The service map now correctly shows all connections between the router and subgraphs.

## What Was Accomplished

- ✅ **Fixed all Docker health checks** - Services now correctly report healthy status
  - Subgraphs: Work around Apollo Server v4 CSRF protection
  - Router: Custom bash-based health check (no curl/wget needed)

- ✅ **Resolved service map visibility issue** - Router now fully visible in Dash0
  - Increased trace sampling from 10% → 100%
  - Identified that traces (not metrics) drive service maps

- ✅ **Enhanced Vegeta load tests** - All subgraphs now receive traffic
  - Created 4 new query files targeting specific subgraphs
  - Added accounts and inventory coverage

- ✅ **Verified trace propagation** - W3C Trace Context working correctly
  - Router propagates `traceparent` headers to subgraphs
  - Full distributed trace visibility in Dash0

## Key Insights

### Docker Compose Health Check Limitations

Docker Compose only supports `exec`-style health checks (running commands inside containers), unlike Kubernetes which supports external HTTP probes. This is a known design gap that forces workarounds:

- **The problem**: Minimal container images (like Apollo Router) don't include curl/wget
- **The workaround**: Use bash's `/dev/tcp` feature or include HTTP tools in the image
- **The insight**: This is a Docker Compose limitation, not an image problem

### Trace Sampling vs Service Maps

**Critical discovery**: Service maps are built from traces, NOT metrics.

- **Metrics** show counts and durations but no relationships
- **Traces** show the request flow between services (parent-child relationships)
- **Sampling matters**: 10% sampling = only 10% of requests create trace links in the service map

Our configuration:
- Router: Was 10%, now 100% (for demo visibility)
- Subgraphs: 100% by default (Node.js SDK)

### Apollo Server CSRF Protection

Apollo Server v4 blocks simple GET requests to health endpoints as potential CSRF attacks. The solution:

```bash
wget --header="apollo-require-preflight: true" "http://localhost:4001/graphql?query={__typename}"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start continuous load testing**:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile load-testing up -d vegeta
   ```

2. **Monitor Dash0 service map**:
   - Verify all 4 subgraph connections remain stable
   - Watch for errors or latency spikes
   - Monitor RED metrics

3. **Investigate duplicate services** (low priority):
   - Clean up services showing 0 requests
   - May be old data or internal router spans

4. **Consider production sampling** (when moving to production):
   - Reduce router sampling back to 10% or lower
   - Configure sampling based on traffic volume
   - Use parent-based sampling for consistency

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docker-compose.yaml` | Updated health checks for all services |
| `router/router.yaml` | Increased trace sampling to 100% |
| `vegeta/accounts-me.json` | New query targeting accounts subgraph |
| `vegeta/accounts-users.json` | New query targeting accounts subgraph |
| `vegeta/products-inventory.json` | New query targeting products + inventory |
| `vegeta/federated-all.json` | Federated query hitting all 4 subgraphs |
| `vegeta/targets.http` | Added new queries to rotation |

## Architecture

## User Actions Required

None - all services are running and healthy. Vegeta can be started when continuous load testing is desired.
