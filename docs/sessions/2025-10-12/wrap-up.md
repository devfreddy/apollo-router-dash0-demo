# Session Wrap-Up: 2025-10-12

## Session Summary

Two-part session: First, troubleshooting Docker Compose profiles and resolving Apollo GraphOS rate limiting issues. Second, instrumenting all subgraph services with OpenTelemetry for complete distributed tracing in Dash0.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Docker Compose Profiles Education
- ✅ Explained what Docker Compose profiles are and how they work
- ✅ Clarified why Vegeta is in the `load-testing` profile (optional, resource-intensive add-on)
- ✅ Demonstrated profile usage: `docker compose --profile load-testing up`

### 2. Resolved Docker Network Issue
- ✅ Diagnosed stale Docker network references causing startup failures
- ✅ Cleaned up containers with `docker compose down`
- ✅ Removed orphaned vegeta container
- ✅ Successfully restarted all services with fresh network configuration

### 3. Investigated Service Unavailable (503) Errors
- ✅ Analyzed router logs showing continuous 503 errors
- ✅ Checked subgraph health status (all marked unhealthy)
- ✅ Identified two root causes:
  1. **Subgraph Health Checks Failing** - Apollo Server CSRF protection blocking wget health checks
  2. **Apollo GraphOS Free Tier Rate Limiting** - The primary cause of 503 errors

### 4. Discovered Apollo GraphOS Rate Limiting
- ✅ Tested router endpoint and found rate limit errors
- ✅ Researched Apollo GraphOS free plan limits: **60 requests/minute**
- ✅ Identified that Vegeta was sending 2 req/sec (120 req/min) - **double the limit**
- ✅ Explained why this causes continuous 503 errors in traces

### 5. Optimized Load Testing Configuration
- ✅ User adjusted Vegeta rate from `2` to `0.8` requests/second
- ✅ Restarted vegeta container with new configuration
- ✅ New rate: 48 req/min - **safely under 60 req/min limit with 20% buffer**

### 6. Instrumented Subgraphs with OpenTelemetry
- ✅ Added OpenTelemetry SDK and auto-instrumentation dependencies to all 4 subgraphs
- ✅ Created reusable OpenTelemetry initialization module ([otel.js](../../../subgraphs/shared/otel.js))
- ✅ Updated all subgraph services to initialize OpenTelemetry before application code
- ✅ Configured Dash0 endpoints and authentication in docker-compose.yaml
- ✅ Rebuilt and deployed all instrumented subgraph containers
- ✅ Verified distributed tracing with end-to-end test query

### 7. Validated Complete Distributed Tracing
- ✅ All 4 subgraphs now emit traces to Dash0: accounts, products, reviews, inventory
- ✅ Each subgraph reports with proper service name and metadata
- ✅ HTTP, GraphQL, and Express instrumentation active on all subgraphs
- ✅ Tested federation query successfully spanning Router → Products → Reviews → Accounts → Inventory

## Key Insights

1. **Docker Compose Profiles** - Powerful feature for optional services like load generators, allowing clean separation of core vs. add-on services

2. **Health Check CSRF Issue** - Apollo Server 4+ blocks simple GET requests without proper headers, causing Docker health checks to fail (minor issue, doesn't affect functionality)

3. **Apollo GraphOS Free Tier Limits** - The most important discovery:
   - **60 requests/minute** for self-hosted routers
   - **1-day data retention** for traces/metrics
   - Rate limit returns `ROUTER_FREE_PLAN_RATE_LIMIT_REACHED` error

4. **Rate Limiting Impact on Observability** - Excessive load testing causes rate limit errors that pollute trace data with 503s instead of showing real application performance

5. **Complete Distributed Tracing** - With OpenTelemetry instrumentation on all subgraphs, we now have:
   - **End-to-end visibility** from Router through all subgraph hops
   - **Service topology mapping** showing all 5 services in Dash0
   - **Performance insights** at every layer of the federated graph
   - **Automatic instrumentation** for HTTP, GraphQL, and Express operations

## Technical Details

### Apollo GraphOS Free Plan Limits
- **Rate Limit**: 60 requests/minute (1 req/sec average)
- **Data Retention**: 1 day for traces, metrics, insights
- **Users**: Up to 3 developers
- **Roles**: Admin and Consumer only
- **Support**: Community only

### Configuration Changes Made

**Load Testing Optimization:**
- `docker-compose.yaml:125` - Changed vegeta rate from `2` to `0.8` req/sec
- Result: 48 req/min load (20% buffer below limit)

**OpenTelemetry Instrumentation:**
- Added 7 OpenTelemetry packages to all subgraph [package.json](../../../subgraphs/accounts/package.json) files
- Created [subgraphs/shared/otel.js](../../../subgraphs/shared/otel.js) - Reusable OpenTelemetry initialization module
- Updated [subgraphs/accounts/index.js](../../../subgraphs/accounts/index.js) - Initialize OpenTelemetry before imports
- Updated [subgraphs/products/index.js](../../../subgraphs/products/index.js) - Initialize OpenTelemetry before imports
- Updated [subgraphs/reviews/index.js](../../../subgraphs/reviews/index.js) - Initialize OpenTelemetry before imports
- Updated [subgraphs/inventory/index.js](../../../subgraphs/inventory/index.js) - Initialize OpenTelemetry before imports
- Updated [docker-compose.yaml](../../../docker-compose.yaml) - Added Dash0 environment variables to all subgraph services

## Next Steps

For the next session, consider these priorities:

1. **Analyze Distributed Traces in Dash0** - Explore the new end-to-end traces showing Router + Subgraph telemetry
2. **Create Comprehensive Dashboard** - Build observability dashboard with both Router and Subgraph metrics
3. **Monitor Success Rate** - Verify that 503 errors are eliminated with optimized rate limit
4. **Set Up Alerts** - Configure alerts for error rates, latency thresholds, and service availability
5. **Fix Subgraph Health Checks** - Add proper headers to wget commands or use different health check method
6. **Optimize GraphQL Queries** - Review and improve Vegeta test queries to reduce any remaining errors
