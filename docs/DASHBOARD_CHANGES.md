# Dashboard Organization Changes

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the Apollo Router Dash0 dashboard from a single 41-panel flat dashboard into **5 focused, organized dashboards** + the original flat dashboard for reference.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Created Organization Tool** (`organize-dashboards.js`)
- Reads the monolithic dashboard JSON
- Splits panels into logical groupings
- Generates 5 separate, focused dashboards
- Can be run independently or as part of the conversion process

### 2. **Updated Conversion Script** (`convert.js`)
- Now automatically calls `organize-dashboards.js` after converting from Datadog
- Generates all 6 dashboards (5 organized + 1 flat) in a single command
- Added helpful output showing what was generated

### 3. **New Dashboards Created**

| Dashboard | File | Panels | Focus Area |
|-----------|------|--------|-----------|
| Client Traffic | `client-traffic-dashboard.json` | 5 | Client → Router metrics |
| Backend Services | `router-backend-dashboard.json` | 6 | Router → Subgraph metrics |
| Router Internals | `router-internals-dashboard.json` | 11 | Query Planning, Cache, Compute Jobs |
| Infrastructure | `infrastructure-dashboard.json` | 8 | CPU/Memory metrics (K8s, Host, Docker) |
| Coprocessors & Sentinel | `coprocessors-dashboard.json` | 11 | Coprocessors & overall health metrics |
| Performance (Original) | `apollo-router-performance.json` | 41 | All panels unorganized (reference) |

### 4. **Documentation**
- Created `DASHBOARD_ORGANIZATION.md` with:
  - Detailed description of each dashboard
  - List of panels in each dashboard
  - Use cases for each dashboard
  - Organization structure diagram
  - Metrics reference guide

## Directory Structure

```
dashboards/
├── dash0/
│   ├── apollo-router-performance.json          (41 panels - main flat)
│   ├── client-traffic-dashboard.json           (5 panels)
│   ├── router-backend-dashboard.json           (6 panels)
│   ├── router-internals-dashboard.json         (11 panels)
│   ├── infrastructure-dashboard.json           (8 panels)
│   └── coprocessors-dashboard.json             (11 panels)
├── datadog/
│   └── graphos-template.json                   (Original Datadog template)
├── convert.js                                  (Updated - now generates organized dashboards)
├── organize-dashboards.js                      (New - dashboard organization tool)
├── deploy.sh                                   (Existing deployment script)

```

## Key Benefits

1. **Focused Monitoring**: Each dashboard focuses on 5-11 related metrics
2. **Easier Navigation**: No more scrolling through 41 panels to find what you need
3. **Better Organization**: Matches the original Datadog grouping structure
4. **Reusable Tool**: `organize-dashboards.js` can reorganize any future dashboards
5. **Automated**: `convert.js` automatically generates organized dashboards
6. **Well Documented**: Complete guide in `DASHBOARD_ORGANIZATION.md`

## Migration Guide

### For Users
If you're deploying these dashboards:

1. **Deploy all dashboards**:
   ```bash
   ./dashboards/deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Or deploy individual dashboards**:
   ```bash
   # Use Dash0 CLI or UI to import the specific JSON files
   ```

3. **Recommended workflow**:
   - Use **Client Traffic** for quick health checks
   - Use **Backend Services** + **Router Internals** for troubleshooting
   - Use **Infrastructure** for capacity planning
   - Use **Coprocessors & Sentinel** for overall health monitoring

### For Developers
If you need to regenerate dashboards:

1. **Convert from Datadog + Organize**:
   ```bash
   node dashboards/convert.js
   ```
   This automatically generates all 6 dashboards.

2. **Just reorganize existing dashboards**:
   ```bash
   node dashboards/organize-dashboards.js
   ```

## Backward Compatibility

- The original `apollo-router-performance.json` is still generated and available
- All existing panel queries and metrics remain unchanged
- The organization is purely structural (different JSON files, same data)

## Files Modified

- ✅ `dashboards/convert.js` - Updated with organize-dashboards integration
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/apollo-router-performance.json` - Regenerated with updated queries

## Files Created

- ✅ `dashboards/organize-dashboards.js` - Dashboard organization tool
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/client-traffic-dashboard.json`
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/router-backend-dashboard.json`
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/router-internals-dashboard.json`
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/infrastructure-dashboard.json`
- ✅ `dashboards/dash0/coprocessors-dashboard.json`
- ✅ `dashboards/DASHBOARD_ORGANIZATION.md`
- ✅ `DASHBOARD_CHANGES.md` (this file)

## Total Panel Count
- **5 organized dashboards**: 5 + 6 + 11 + 8 + 11 = 41 panels
- **1 flat dashboard**: 41 panels
- **Total across all**: 41 panels (same panels, different organization)

## Next Steps

1. Review the dashboards in `dashboards/dash0/`
2. Test importing them into Dash0
3. Verify that all panels display correctly
4. Deploy using `./dashboards/deploy.sh`
5. Remove the original `apollo-router-performance.json` if not needed
